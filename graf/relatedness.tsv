# HG match: number of SNPs with matched genotypes when only homozygous SNPs are counted
# HG miss: number of SNPs with mismatched genotypes when only homozygous SNPs are counted
# HGMR: Homozygous Genotype Mismatch Rate (%)
# AG match: number of SNPs with matched genotypes when all SNPs are counted
# AG miss: number of SNPs with mismatched genotypes when all SNPs are counted
# AGMR: All Genotype Mismatch Rate (%)
# Geno rel: relationship determined by sample genotypes. ID = identical subjects or twins; PO = parent-offspring; FS = full sibling; D2 = second degree relative; D3 = third degree relative; UN = unrelated or remotely related subjects
# Ped rel: Relationship derived from pedigree file. DP = duplicated samples; MT = monozygotic twins; PO = parent-offspring; FS = full sibling; SB = sibling with one parent missing in pedigree; HS = half sibling; GP = grandparent-grandchild; AV = avuncular; HA = half avuncular; FC = first cousin; HC = half first cousin; HF = half sibling + first cousin (half siblings whose fathers or mothers are full siblings)# p_value: Probability that the genetic relationship is NOT the predicted type
#
# Expected HGMR and AGMR values (%) for different types of relationships:
# FS HGMR: 4.9796
# D2 HGMR: 11.5032
# D3 HGMR: 17.6069
# PO AGMR: 40.6049
# FS AGMR: 34.1190
# D2 AGMR: 47.9355
# D3 AGMR: 51.6007
